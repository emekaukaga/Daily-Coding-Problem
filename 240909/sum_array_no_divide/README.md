Solution to the September 9, 2024 Daily Coding Problem.
Used a left and right pass solution to avoid both the use of division as well as to optimize the efficiency of my program.
This solution has a time complexity of O(n) which is optimal for this problem, and solves for the question.

With more time I would have added some edge condition checks and input validation for handling empty or single element arrays.
